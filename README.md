Slides and code for Chris Foster's JuliaCon 2016 talk, "Accurate 3D mapping with Geodesy and Proj4".

The talk consists of a julia script `slides.jl` which drives the 3D visualization program [displaz](github.com/c42f/displaz) to display data sets and slides.
Slides were written in latex with the beamer package, and rasterized to OpenGL textures to display together in a unified 3D view.

Custom keys defined in the displaz 3D view:
  * Next slide: "n"
  * Previous slide: "p"
  * Toggle UI elements: "t"

To get the talk to work in full detail, you'd need the raw datasets which are unfortunately several GB in size.  The rest of the stuff is here though.
